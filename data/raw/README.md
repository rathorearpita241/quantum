# Quantum Bee Climate Project

This project explores the use of honeybee biological signals (movement, spatial patterns)
to infer climatic behavior using a hybrid Classical and Quantum Machine Learning pipeline.

## Project Pipeline
- Bee movement data ingestion
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Classical ML baseline (Random Forest)
- Quantum feature encoding using statevector methods
- Hybrid classical–quantum comparison

## 🔬 Results
- Classical Random Forest achieved low MSE on synthetic bee–climate data.
- Quantum similarity kernel captured non-linear feature relationships.
- Hybrid approach demonstrates potential for climate proxy modeling.

## ⚛️ Quantum Advantage
Quantum feature encoding maps biological proxies into high-dimensional Hilbert space,
enabling similarity computation beyond classical kernels.
